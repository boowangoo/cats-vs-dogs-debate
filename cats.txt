# Cats are better than dogs.

They are low maintenance, cuter, and cuddlier. They don’t bark, they just give soft meows. They stay out your way, but will also lay with you if you pick them up and put them on your lap. They purr when they are happy, which is also adorable. Nuff said.

##### Animals are only as friendly as you train and nurture them to be. If you ignore or abuse your cat or dog then they’re going to be a shitty animal.All these people complaining about cats scratching shit and bitting are the same people who treat them poorly in the first place.AND YES, I am aware that some animals are beyond help, so save the “BuT tHe CaT/dOg CaMe Up AnD bIt ME”. ⏤ by *NotARealIcelander* (↑ 20/ ↓ 0)
##### Personally, I can't stand dogs (bitten as a child, had to share a garden with a neighbours aggressive bulldog for 5 years), and love my cats.That said, people are different, and as long as they keep them under control and away from me, who am I to say what pets someone else can enjoy. ⏤ by *klc81* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)
##### Meh, matter of lifestyle. I have two dogs. Eldest is 8, his sister 7. They gave transformed my life. I'm sure I'd say the same thing about a cat. Only problem with cats, they are night time predators. They don't belong in your apartment cooped up, but if you unleash them outside they destroy song bird populations. My dogs? They protect me on walks, hikes, in my home. They cuddle with me endlessly, sit by my side. I appreciate cats, but they don't suit my lifestyle. I need a companion, not a friend. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 30/ ↓ 0)
├─ A lot of this may often be the case of cats, but cats, like dogs, are individuals and behave differently from one another.My cat was super chill and very cuddly. He never seemed particularly interested in going outside, and wouldn't ever hurt a fly.Course cats can and often are "nighttime hunters" but I feel like saying this is how all cats are just gives dog people reason to say cats are mean and too much of a handful. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 11/ ↓ 0)
├─ “They don’t belong in an apartment cooped up”No, these would be dogs, that you need to take outside twice a day for half an hour at least and can’t leave unattended or they freak. I’ve raised many cats with no street access and they were absolutely fine and lived long, healthy lives. It’s ok to know nothing about cats if you’re a dog person, just letting you know that’s not the case. In my country of origin you won’t even be allowed to adopt a cat if you intend to let it out of the house (they can get run over, poisoned, lost or beaten/killed by a-holes). ⏤ by *KittenFunk* (↑ 11/ ↓ 0)
├── Thanks for clarifying. We are overran by feral populations here. We have seasons for kittens. Cat behavior is similar to canine, something that I am still figuring out. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### I mean obviously. Apparently, people can't even leave their dogs at home without the dog pissing and shitting or getting destructive. So you end up with people dragging their dogs with them wherever they go, sometimes having to leave them in the car.True on all your points as well. I'll take meows and purrs any day over the sounds that dogs make.You also don't hear about children (or even adults) getting mauled and killed by cats. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 16/ ↓ 0)

##### As an animal lover I can say I like both, but due to my personality/lifestyle I prefer to raise cats. That will never stop me from walking to random doggos on the street and making a big fuss. They’re adorable. Just not for me. What I don’t tend to like? Dog people. Most seem to think they are somewhat superior in their choice of pet and unable to state a simple preference without criticising cats and cat people, often with fallacies that anyone who has ever had a cat knows aren’t true. You totally can have a preference for dogs’ extroverted personalities without being an arse to people who happen to prefer less rambunctious, gentler, easier maintenance pets.

##### I have 3 dogs and 3 cats and 1 snake.  I have 4 kids and a wife.  Who does all the pet maintenance?  Me. If I had to keep the same number of pets but could trade the out, I’d trade my 3 dogs for 3 cats any day.  Dogs are loving and great, but a shit load of work that grows exponentially with the more you have. On the other hand, I would trade all my cats and dogs for 6 snakes.  Feed them once a week, or maybe once every 2 weeks, clean their cage once or twice a month.  So effing easy.  I can cuddle with my neighbors dog. So yes, cats over dogs all life long.  But I love them both. ⏤ by *durma5* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)

##### *Personal* opinion? I agree with you. I like cats way more than dogs. They're more graceful, self-contained, easygoing and you don't need to take them outside to do their business. They're soft and fuzzy and I love that they purr.On the flipside if you have indoor cats like I do, you're solely responsible for maintaining their litter trays and cleaning up their waste. What's worse is that we have a longhaired cat and poop will often get caught in his leg fluff, meaning we need to clean him too! There is honestly no smell on earth worse than that of cat poop.Still, it's totally worth it and to make things easier we trim the hair around his butt (yes, ask any longhaired cat owner, it's a thing) with an electric razor. We also have multiple enclosed cat litter boxes. Just need to clean them regularly and there won't be too much of an odour problem.I'm not actually a fan of comparing cats and dogs, they're completely different animals. Literally the only thing they have in common is that they can be domestic pets. I prefer cats because they're easier to take care of (they still need a good amount of care, just not as much as dogs), require less of your attention and it's OK to keep them in smaller places. Plus, cats don't freak out and get separation anxiety if you have to go to work. We got 2 cats anyway just in case (thankfully they get on like a house on fire), but they're not pack animals like dogs are and they are more independent.Dogs are amazing animals for sure and make wonderful companions. They just need a heckload of care and attention. Personal preference wise I'll pick cats every time. My cats do get a lot of love and fuss, but they'll also just chill and go for a nap or play with each other when we're busy with other stuff. They're easy like that. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
##### Like usual it really depends on the animal, I've really always preferred cats for the reasons you listed, but they can be real demons sometimes too.

##### I love both, and actually have both, but I love coming home to my crazy, energetic dog running around in circles screeching because she’s so happy to see. The most my cat does is stare at me like, “Who the fuck are you?” If I say, “Taffy! Come here,” my dog SPRINTS to me so she can lay on my lap. “June Bug! Come here”, my cat just stares at me like, “... Who the fuck are you?”People say, “dogs are high maintenance because you have to take them outside,” but what the hell do you call cleaning out a cat’s litter box so it doesn’t smell up your house? You can train your dog to go on pads, it’s essentially the same thing. You have to care for both animals, saying cats use a litter box is a weak argument for saying their better.They’re cuddlier? Whaaa I’ve never had a cat lay down beside me so I could rub their tummy for two straight episodes of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. You can’t even rub their damn tummies.

├─ It’s not cruel, but I agree that it’s not good for a cat to live in a small place with very little room. Cats and dogs are completely different animals. Just because dogs need to be taken on walks and can be taken hunting doesn’t mean that cats also need to. And, unlike dogs, cats that live solely indoors is a lot safer and indoor cats live a lot longer. And, most cats are actually very active.
