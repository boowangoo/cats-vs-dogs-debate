##### I prefer cats, cause sometimes I just don't have enough energy to give it to dogs. ⏤ by *TvDevilCorp* (↑ 122/ ↓ 0)
├─ Some types of cats will change your mind on that. I have a 1.5 year old and I can play fetch for an hour and he still brings it back. Crazy amount of energy in that one ⏤ by *mlsweeney* (↑ 19/ ↓ 0)

├─── I do but the other one is 10 years old. Horrible combo ⏤ by *mlsweeney* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├──── Ah understandable. I have an 18-year-old and a 4-year-old, which is also not ideal, especially because the 4-year-old is about 3x as big as the 18-year-old =\\ Luckily the dog volunteers to help sometimes so the old lady gets a break. ⏤ by *AryaStarkRavingMad* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├───── Lol I feel ya. The 10 year old is a small female and the 1.5 year old is male and 5 pounds heavier. Maybe a dog is the missing equation? We've had dogs over and it's perfect for the young one ⏤ by *mlsweeney* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

##### Cats. Dogs remind me of children constant need for attention and they need proper stimulation. Cats are more like roommates, they acknowledge your existence and if they want something they come to you otherwise they are happy in their space. I can also leave cats for a period of time and know the house won’t get torn apart and as long as they have a good supplies of food and water and a clean litter box they’ll be fine for the day. ⏤ by *Jumpy_Spinach7962* (↑ 71/ ↓ 0)
├─ Some cats are needy, and some cats are insane & destructive - but for the most part this is right on ⏤ by *EugeneVictorDabs* (↑ 15/ ↓ 0)
├── I feel like cats, way more than dogs, match the energy of their owners. My cats are chatty and chill, because I'm chatty and chill. My MIL's cats are always crazy and destructive because.. well, you can guess where this is going. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 14/ ↓ 0)
├─── Is this why my cat is aloof 😭 ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├──── Haha I know you're joking, but yea I think people who are a bit more standoffish with their cats have cats who are a bit more aloof. I'm very gregarious and treat my cats like main characters, but they're naturally a bit aloof and not very cuddly. But they always talk to me and choose to be in the same room as me. So I think it *is* a combination of natural traits and environment, but that environment plays a bigger role than people think. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├───── My cat is similar, he’s Ragdoll so he’s patient with me when I get cute aggression and hug pet him and kiss him, you should see his face he hates his life when I do it 😭This is why I’m not his favourite person my daughter is because she ignores him. He even asks her for pets and only comes to me if in that moment she doesn’t wanna do it.Sometimes I talk to him and I swear he rolls his eyes. He only talks on the rare occasion i forgot to scoop the tray then he looks at me and then at tray. Otherwise he calls me for food and he does the eye thing. I noticed my dog talks to me like that too but she grumbles in frustration when I don’t get it 😭Sorry I’ve rambled enough 🤦🏻‍♀️ ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### Cats are just so chill and easy to take care of. They're practically self-sufficient. They are also so deeply affectionate. ⏤ by *leduderino7* (↑ 60/ ↓ 0)
├─ They’re also deeply evil and manipulative because they’re so cuuuute. My cat broke my gf’s macbook pro and she thought it was on accident (and was asking for cuddles all the time for 2-3 days after) but I’m sure it was on purpose. Still love that furball to death. ⏤ by *vinnybawbaw* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### I love dogs, I just don’t want to be responsible for one. I love my kitties. And I think I understand them more. My mother-in-law recently asked me if I’d ever be interested in a dog.

├─── Nope. I have friends and family member who will most definitely call me out if my house stunk. It doesn't, even with two cats. It's called simple house maintenance.

##### I prefer cats. It doesn't mean I don't like dogs though, I just *prefer* cats. I like a quiet household and I think cats are more comfy in a quiet environment, plus they're really cute and fluffy. Just be careful if you get a longhaired cat.

##### I love both cats and dogs but I prefer to live with cats because dogs are way too needy and you have to go out and walk them. I like how cats are so much more independent minded like when I had my parents dog over I couldn’t understand why if I stay up late it also meant the dog had to stay up late too whimpering why I’m not going to bed like why can’t you just go to sleep without me I don’t get it? ⏤ by *Catprincessmeoww* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)
##### Cats. But not by too much. I really like dogs too. I’ve noticed cats like me a lot more than dogs. I’ve also been attacked by dogs before, and it seems they’re a bit aggressive towards me. ⏤ by *Great-Hatsby* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)
##### Love cats. Purring is top tier comfort. Also they are quiet. ⏤ by *Gunbuckets* (↑ 9/ ↓ 0)

##### Cats.  You dont have to take them outside to use the bathroom, my cat leaves me alone when I want to be left alone, and mine actually growls at the doorbell and DOES NOT get on my counters or scratch my furniture.  Cats can be trained nicely, you just have to start off when they are young and follow through with it. ⏤ by *Jesikabelcher* (↑ 16/ ↓ 0)

##### Dogs u can take them for a walk and they are less scratchy and they dont walk on your food counters ⏤ by *FirstJellyfish307* (↑ 21/ ↓ 0)
├─ My cats learned to go on walks.  When they were kittens they followed me everywhere.  When I would take out the garbage they would follow me. Now whenever they see me with a garbage bag they all follow me.  I trained them by whistling, which means catch up.  The thing is they like repetition.  They like to walk the same route.  They know about 50 words.  So I'll ask them if they want to go on a "walk"and all three will follow me as I walk 5 blocks around my complex.  They are not on leashes but follow me because of love.  It makes me happy to have three cats trailing after me as we do our sunset walks.  Cats are not subservient like dogs.  You have to earn their affection but when you do it is a blessing. ⏤ by *jediciahquinn* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)

├──── If you scoop the box in the morning, and evening and change the liner every month. It's only gonna stink when they are shitting. ⏤ by *tenebras_lux* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├──── Both are true. You can smell the box right when you walk in if it's anywhere near the door and it hasn't been scooped all day. But a box that doesn't need to be scooped and gets fresh litter every week won't be detectable. Likewise, clean, well groomed dogs won't smell. But I have legit walked into apartments once or twice that were for rent, and I could smell lingering dog odor from the last tenants. Like, that wet-dog smell, but just everywhere. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)

##### Cats. They’re much cleaner than dogs and care about their personal hygiene. I loved my late Australian shepherd, but I’ll be the first to say that she was a natural-born dirt ball. Despite our frequent bathing and grooming of her, she always managed to get filthy and stinky in short order. I remember in the summer she sometimes had a small cadre of flies following her around outside. Beyond all that, cats seem more intelligent and caring than dogs. I love their natural curiosity. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 18/ ↓ 0)
├─ I'm surprised to see someone say that cats are more caring. Because I really feel like that too. More often then not dogs just seem like they just want to use me. Bark at me to go outside, bark at me to scratch an itch, demand that I do something for them, all that. Cats have been so much more loving to me in my life than dogs. Every cat that I have lived with and raised has been a PERFECT cat. And the thing is, I respect their right to consent, they also have been very naturally lenient with that because they learn to trust me, because I respect their consent. It's a very interesting type of relationship building that people don't/can't do with dogs.There has been one cat that has not liked people bending down to touch her, and that is because my little cousin and her family got her when she was young, and that child choke held her for minutes on end. That cat was partially traumatized. She however does love touching me on her terms (which I feel complimented by) and has never been aggressive when stating her boundaries. When a cat doesn't like to be touched it should be respected. They usually have a good reason. I dislike it when people dislike cats because they seem like they are off-putting, when in reality, it's probably how you raised it. ⏤ by *Street_Corgi_3441* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)

##### I am scared of unknown dogs and I have always been more comfortable with cats. I have also taken care of cats and I have never had any problems with cats ⏤ by *Nikke_87* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
##### Cats. The biggest reason is probably because that's just what I'm used to. I have not gone a single day of my life without a cat, while I haven't had a dog since I was 8 or 9 years old. But also:\-They're less work. They bathe themselves. I don't have to walk them. There's very little training required. I don't have to get up or come home at any particular time so they can relieve themselves and I don't have to go outside to scoop poop. Litterboxes aren't exactly fun, but I still find them preferable to dealing with dog mess. \-They don't have body odor the way dogs do. \-They're generally quieter. Granted, my Siamese mix is quite vocal and can be rather loud, but I will take that over barking, howling, and whining any day. \-They're more independent. Which is not to say that they're never needy. My Siamese mix is very demanding of attention, but nothing like a dog. \-To me, they're cuter. Especially the orange ones. I'm a sucker for the orange ones. ⏤ by *Resident_Bitch* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
##### Cats don't make noise and are independent. A good homebuddy and a sleeping partner. They have a cute voice and their purring known to have healing properties. And the best thing is they give you space and are not intrusive. ⏤ by *Cute-Specialist2791* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)

##### Cats. They are affectionate, have extremely distinct personalities, live for 15-30 years, they are reasonably self sufficient for a pet, and they are cute as hell.Just got 2 kittens in fact to keep our older lady company (her brother of 17 years just died in Oct).The preference is there but it's not huge.

##### I have a cat(Max) and a dog(Sirius) I don't have a preference, but I do like to make sure they have the right attitude for me. Max and Sirius are very chill, but extremely defiant. I take care of them and never have a problem with them, but I am also not 18 yet. My parents kicked me out and promised me I would be able to visit them and come and get them when I'm able. But since they kicked me out, they have had nothing but problems with them. I love it. Max and Sirius are very intelligent breeds of animals and they never bothered to ask me how to properly manage them. They both are very rebellious and need a specific amount of attention and mental stimulation to keep them from acting this way. In hindsight, it all comes down to the amount of attention and care you can put into them. If you don't have much time on your hands, a cat would probably suffice. ⏤ by *OutcomeRough5861* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

##### I worked with animals most of my life, i personally like dogs better, they are often more expressive and i build a better trust relationship with them. I’ve had 5 cats and while i liked them it is not the same relationship at all. The one big advantage of cats is that they require less maintenance and are more independent.  So if you like to travel or work a-lot, a cat is better, if you want a small 2year old human on 4 legs get a dog.My dog is always happy when he sees me, my cats would hiss at me for random reasons sometimes, then cuddle, then hiss. Cats feel like dating someone with BPD.Still love them all but ill always be a dog guy even if they require a-lot more work. ⏤ by *anbelroj* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### I love them both. But hubby is allergic to cats. So we have dogs. I would have both if we could. Dogs are great protection and keep predators away from my chickens. ⏤ by *pennamechris123* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### Love both. Really just depends on the individual animal. Some cats are violent jerks, some are the sweetest things ever. Some dogs are ill-behaved, house-wrecking nuisances, some are low-maintenance and awesome. Dogs are definitely more work, but I’d also argue that they can yield more reward. There’s a special bond that forms with an animal that you go out and explore the world with and train. It’s so much fun to see them slowly learn commands. Cats can take care of themselves which is hugely convenient. Pros and cons! ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### Dogs cause golden retrievers Cats are cool too but I'd rather have a golden retriever ⏤ by *RedditorManIsHere* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### Honestly? I feel like they aren't comparable. I've had a lot more bad memories with dogs than I have with cats, so if I had to pick an answer I'd say id hate dogs more.Dogs actually kill things first of all. They are actually dangerous. You are seriously judged when you have a dog that is capable of that. My parents didn't teach me how to raise a puppy (they wanted it) but they work full time jobs so it was mine at 14 to parent a dog. That ROTTWEILER was horrible and traumatic. I became a little abusive. She killed my chickens, she hurt because she was big, it was... It was natural. Her behavior was completely natural. I just don't like that level of stress (that dog got hit by a semi-truck at a young age, my new dog is a lot better. I didn't want him either. He's my dog though, again.)Cats, people just don't know how to raise cats. They serve an entirely different function and that's evident by the comparison of cats and dogs. Dogs are workers. They require maintenance and actual intent. That's what they were for from lap dog to herder to sled puller. Cats have passive reasons to be. They actually domesticated themselves at first because our food stores had pests.Cats and us truly have a symbiotic relationship, cats are genetically nearly the same as they were hundreds of years ago. They exist to live in our homes, cuddle with us, and thrive in our *environment*.Something I learned from the cat whisperer guy is that good behavior in dogs is based on training, and good behavior in cats is based on the environment. Litter boxes here, play time there, cat tree by the window. That's the setup for a good kitten and eventually cat, unless they have a mental disorder. Cats are born set up with everything we will ever need them for. Dogs are a project. ⏤ by *Street_Corgi_3441* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### I grew up with dogs my entire life. Me and my wife wanted to get a pet for our apartment, but at the time they only allowed cats and small animals, so we decided to go ahead and get a cat.I’m now a cat supremacist. They are superior to dogs. Dogs are so fucking needy and require so much play to get energy out, not to mention the need to take them out all the time to go to the bathroom. Cats are chill as fuck, super entertaining, require little resources (food, water, liter box, and a cardboard box and their fucking golden)Cats all the way. Dogs are way too much and far more expensiveDon’t get me wrong, I like dogs! Just not as much as cats ⏤ by *PANPHONE* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### Cats, they tend to be less noisy. After having to deal with two full sized poodles from my roommate while working grave and getting very little sleep, meows are a lot easier to tune out.

I've had no many neighbors that just leave their beast to bark ALL DAY.

├──── Or is the abundance of training required to not have them want to murder cats, birds, and other animals? Or bark at strangers? Or not be judged by most people? Dogs are scary men. I've known so many more dogs with God complexes and absolutely psychopathic behavior (growling, barking, killing, escaping, just aggressive shit) then cats.Bad dogs are so much worse than bad cats. Cats are also so much easier to make good. I've raised a lot of them. Oftentimes people just make the mistake of disliking the cat before it's an adult, and that attitude makes the cat bad. That's literally it. Dogs with issues kill other dogs, cats, and sometimes even people... ⏤ by *Street_Corgi_3441* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### I prefer big dogs that don't shed like ours do.We've had both. Our cat was psychotic. Would cause all sorts of hell just to get our dog to chase her. I used to hear the cat running around in the middle of the night and it would sound like a herd of elephants! Our dogs are also crazy. Our 15 year old jack russell will bark at anyone who doesn't give her attention. She is right at everyone's feet (people have tripped over her). She would also show you where valuables are as long as you make sure to pet her. But she doesn't watch out for anyone else to the point she has knocked the kids over. Our 10 year old lab is extremely laid back but too big in our house but she can't run the yard because she doesn't stay on the property. So she's in a kennel unless we're outside. She's great with our kids and only our kids. Our 7 year old lab only listens to me and he is wonderful with all kids! He is also an outside dog because I didn't have the time to properly potty train him. He's also in a kennel unless we're outside. The bad thing about our dogs is they all shed horribly. I brush them once a week and they get baths once a month, weather permitting and not in the winter time. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
##### I don't know where all the comments about independent non-needy non-noisy cats come from. I like cats but good thing I like dogs because my cats have mostly been as needy and interactive as my dogs and sometimes much louder.I prefer dogs, because I don't look like a weirdo taking long walks in the evenings if I have a reason. I like hiking and outdoor stuff. I like the feeling of safety even a fairly little dog can offer. I had a Burmese who played fetch and answered the door but she couldn't be as "protective" as even a small dog. She was almost the perfect puppy cat though.I generally like doggish cats and catlike dogs. But a catlike dog can do all the snuggly companion and silently staring out the window stuff and then go for a long rambling walk on lead, and then lay around and watch me do the gardening without eating the birds. I like walking 5 km a day then feeling like someone might not try and break in. Even a very personable and endearing and bonded cat can't be asked to participate for that. Though I do think there is probably a tipping point where a cat is just a lot more robust than a similar sized dog. My partner was encouraging me to look at 3 kg dogs and idk I don't worry about a 3 kg cat the same way. ⏤ by *horticulturallatin* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)

##### I sat down and compared when I wanted to get my first adult pets.Trainability: Dogs win, no contest.Dogs can be taught to do just about anything, especially if you get a smart breed. They love to make their owners happy and will do almost anything you ask if you show them how. There's a reason some dogs have literal careers.Contrary to popular belief, you absolutely can train a cat, but it will be on the cat's terms. Few cat breeds are easy trainees, though Siamese and a couple of others can be taught to play fetch, walk on a leash, and generally do dog things with relative ease. Cats are mostly food motivated and will quickly decide to forget whatever you taught them if you aren't offering a treat every single time.Independence: Cats win, mostly.Cats are, on average, easier to manage than dogs. Give them toys, or have more than one cat, and they will entertain themselves. You can go on vacation and leave them with some clean litter boxes and a food dispenser (or just lots of food bowls if your cats aren't overeaters) and they'll survive for a week no problem. They can do plenty of exercise with just your furniture. Cats are not for people who need to be needed, but they are fine for busy people with jobs.For dogs, you are the center of the universe. Dogs cannot do *anything* without you. They can't go take a leak unless you have a dog flap and a fenced in yard. You have to take them on walks -- they can't exercise by themselves. Many people can't even leave their dog alone for 6-8 hours to do a job without taking them to doggie day care. It's like having a toddler that never grows up. I think dogs are for people who want babies but don't want someone to talk back to them.Instinctive training: Cats, by far.Cats are just natural pets, so long as they haven't been traumatized early in life or are feral. Take a kitten and put it in a litter box, and it immediately knows this is the bathroom. It is relatively chill when it comes to other human beings as long as it's passively exposed to them. It will do predictable behaviors: play with small objects, sleep in sunbeams, sit on your lap, so on.Dogs are unholy messes right out the gate. Puppies will piss *everywhere*. They chew. They yap. They're basically infants with paws. Again, I understand why dogs are joked to be the baby-sim experience. You have to train them not to jump at or bark at humans and other dogs. (And some of them will never be mellow around others, but they still have to be walked in public...)Cleanliness: Cats, but some disagree.I refuse to care for any animal whose poop I have to put my fingers on. With a dog, you carry around a bag and you literally *lift the feces up with your hand*. I cannot describe how much I want to throw up when I consider this idea. I am extremely intense about how much I hate poop. Dogs will also eat the foulest stuff, whereas cats are pretty fastidious. Dogs also smell. I know you think your dog doesn't because you wash it, and maybe you're right, but you're rare. Most dogs reek, and the smell rubs off on your hand. Cats have minimal smell themselves. As for the litter box, if you're okay being wasteful, you actually don't have to even get near the poop. You can put a liner under the litter, like a trash bag, and just flip it inside out and remove all the litter at once if you're averse. However, I do scoop these days, with a long-handled scooper. It makes the process bearable enough. I would never do it with my hand. Uuuugh.Some think cat litter has a perpetual stink. I say, my nose is excellent and I've never smelled a cat box that wasn't significantly dirty. If you smell litter and the box isn't repulsive, you are using the wrong litter, the cat isn't burying its waste (you probably didn't use enough litter), or  you've put the litter box in a high human traffic area, which...really? Why did you do this? Trust me, maintain a cat box right and you're fine. Worst case, actually, you can buy vented covers for the litter box and vent the smell right out a window. They have screens and fans that pull the air out. I hate the smell of used litter, and I have 3 cats. It's doable.Danger: Cats win by orders of magnitude.Many dogs can straight up kill you. Cats simply cannot.Variety: Dogs.Cat breeds are mostly similar compared to dog breeds. Sure, you have your Maine Coon giants and your Munchkins with tiny legs, but that's nothing compared to a German Shepherd vs a beagle vs a Chihuahua vs a collie vs...you get the idea. Most cats are bred for appearances and a bit for the weather, but they all were for pest control. Most dogs, until recent history, were bred for a combination of appearance and work. They've done everything from herding to hunting.Housing Convenience: Cats.It's easier to find landlords okay with cats than with dogs. There are no "bully breeds" of cats, either. Whereas if you have anything that slightly resembles a pit bull or pit mix, good luck getting home insurance.&#x200B;So in short, IMO, cats win. They're easy to "start up" as pets; they're small; nobody is scared of them; rentals don't mind them; they need no training. If I had infinite time and a lot more land, I would own a dog as well, but I'd want something like a husky or border collie: a dog that has all the traits that cause me right now to not be able to own a dog. What appeals to me about dogs (trainability, intelligence, energy) means I just can't. ⏤ by *Alcoraiden* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
##### Dogs - but specifically, non-hypoallergenic breeds.  There is a common misconception that dogs are more work than cats, and that hypoallergenic dogs are also better because “they don’t shed”.  Both are false. Also, for the record, I’ve owned all above mentioned.  1) picking up dog shit it nowhere near as inconvenient or annoying as maintaining a litter box. Then you add in hairballs, the unbearably acrid smell of their piss, the scratching, knocking shit over, possum attitude etc. and a Dog is just a net positive.  2) dogs require walks, playtime, mental stimulation and love. This makes them not ideal for folks who love alone, and spend large parts of time away from home. While cats can be self-sufficient for more extended periods. This is a con for many people, but actually being forced to go in multiple walks a day and care for a totally dependant creature is actually a boon for ME. I do think people shouldn’t have dogs if they have a busy work schedule, and maybe a cat is better, but I don’t see the walking as a negative.  3) cats generally shed way more than dogs, and non-shedding dogs are gross as fuck after a couple days without being groomed. I have a dog that sheds a lot, but a quick brushing and a roomba sorts that out and I only have to bathe him once a year.  4) the love and relationship you can formWith a dog is so much stronger than anything you can form with a cat. Also, cats are extremely dirty creatures and complete savages. 5) I love cats and dogs. I love all animals. But something like a corgi, a huskey, a shiba, bulldog, etc. are all going to be far better than anything like a shitzu, Maltese or any type of cat.  No offence ⏤ by *josiahpapaya* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
