# Dogs are better pets than cats

I know that a lot of people like dogs, but lately, aside from the memes, it seems like cats are way more popular nowadays, and honestly, I have no clue why.  

Dogs are better pets than cats no matter which way you put it, I've got 3 main arguments here.

#Argument 1:  Loyalty

A dog is a true companion.  Dogs are loyal to their owners and their family.  A cat?  No, not so much...

Cats spend most of their day sleeping and hiding in hard to reach places, they don't care about you.  

I don't care what you say, cats do not care about their owners, dogs do.  

Someone breaks in?  A dog will attack the intruder.  A cat?  Not at all.

Even small dogs will bark and growl at an intruder, alerting you to their presence, whereas a cat will just slink away and hide.

Dogs will listen to commands, cats won't.  

Dogs will follow you around all goddamn day long, because they want to spend time with their owners, cats tell you to go fuck yourself and run off and hide somewhere and sleep all damn day long.

There have been studies done, and it turns out that cats actually don't love their owners.  If the owner dies, a dog will sit by the corpse, lick it, and cry.  A cat will start eating your corpse the second your body hits the ground.

#Argument 2:  A dog is less prone to attack their owners

Much less.  As long as you're not an asshole to the dog, the dog will not be violent, and even then, even if you're an asshole to the dog, it probably wouldn't get violent.  Even the large dogs like German Shepards.  

Cats attack their owners.  Cats scratch and hiss at their owners.  The closest thing a dog will come to that is play biting, which fucking hurts, but they're not attacking you like a cat would, they think you're playing with them.  

Dogs are most certainly more dangerous than cats, a single bite can crush your hand, they have those long canine teeth and those weird, sharp molars, but they won't attack their owners unless the owner abuses them, whereas a cat will fucking scratch the shit out of you for absolutely no reason at all.

#Argument 3  Dogs are more useful than cats

A dog will take commands, a dog will protect you, a dog is just man's best friend.  

Dogs are already more useful than cats because they protect their owners and take commands.  However, there are a few more things dogs can do that a cat can't.

Pest control(sort of).  Dogs can sniff out bed bugs and alert you if there are any.  Dogs are also better at keeping those goddam rodents out of the backyard.  

Cats can do this too, but cats don't spend much of their time outside, and cats are small and weak.  A cat can take on smaller prey, but anything of similar size and a cat stands no chance. 

One of the most annoying backyard animals is raccoons.  A dog can kill a raccoon, a cat can't.  A dog can also bark and scare them away.  A cat can't do that.

A dog will bark, a dog can scare backyard pests away, whereas cats can't.

Not to mention the fact that dogs can also hunt.  If you're a hunter, you can train your dog and bring him/her with you on a hunting trip to help you track game.  A cat cannot.

#Argument 4:  Dogs are nicer

Dogs are 100% nicer.  A dog will jump up on the couch next to you and roll over for a belly rub.  A dog will let you pet them.  A dog will constantly want to go outside and play.  A dog will wait for you to come home everyday from work or school.  A cat does none of those things.

tl;dr

Dogs are better than cats in every way, shape, and form

##### Yeah this is probably the most popular opinion I have seen on this sub this month. I'm not sure what echo chamber you're in to think the general consensus favors cats, but join just about any social media and you'll see. I would even go as far as to say it's nauseating how obsessed a lot of people act towards their dogs and dogs in general. It's become a totally new personality trait to love "doggos"  ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 22/ ↓ 0)
├─ He’s not claiming that dogs are more popular. He’s claiming it’s a scientifically proven fact, which I would say is unpopular. The popular belief (and the fact) is that while dogs are more popular, they aren’t necessarily “better” because it’s a matter of preference. OP believes dogs are absolutely proven to be superior regardless of personal preference. I’ve tried explaining his “reasoning” (dogs are more protective and “useful”) isn’t a positive trait in what a lot of people are looking for in a pet, but he doesn’t get that.  ⏤ by *AwesomeAni* (↑ -1/ ↓ 0)

##### 1. Yeah, cats can be selfish, but they’re also independent, meaning they don’t need nearly as much attention (no training, no walks, no baths, etc.)2. Cats usually attack their owners if their environment isn’t safe, they’re teething, they want to play but there are no toys around, or if the owner is doing something wrong (like forcing it to do stuff against its will). Basically, if a cat scratches/hisses/bites you, it’s for a reason.3. Yeah, you’re right about that one. However,  I find barking 1000x more annoying than meowing lol (maybe because it’s a lot louder. Idk). Also, you contradicted yourself there; one moment you said cats can hunt for small prey, but then after that, you said cats can’t hunt at all.4. Eh, depends. You really need to know how to take care of both, otherwise both might actually hate you.In the end, I actually love both dogs and cats equally, but I think cats are just a tad bit easier to take care of. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 8/ ↓ 0)
├─ >you said cats can hunt for small prey, but then after that, you said cats can’t hunt at all.They can hunt small prey, but if there's a group of raccoons in your backyard throwing your garbage all over the place, a cat won't do shit.

Basically, if a cat scratches/hisses/bites you, it’s for a reason.Dogs don't attack their owners even if they're teething or if there's no toys around.  You're gonna get bit if you abuse it tho, same with cats.  That's the only similarity, if the owner is abusive, they're getting attacked.But the difference is that cats will sometimes attack unprovoked.Barking is actually useful, tho a bit more annoying, and way louder, it's actually useful.  A dog barking will keep robbers out, and will scare away those annoying ass raccoons and chipmunks. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

├───────── My dog’s scared off raccoons before.  He’s a labradoodle if that matters.  Anyways, he had to pee, so I let him into the backyard, and I heard noises and barking.I go outside, and there’s five raccoons, and four of them took off running the second they saw him.One of them decided to stay back and fight my dog for whatever reason.Then my dog growled, the raccoon growls, and my dog grabs the fucking thing by the neck and bites it, blood everywhere.  Then he drops it on the ground.  It was twitching and still breathing, so my dog grabs it a second time, this time on the skull.He bit down on the raccoons skull, then I heard a sort of *crunch* and the racxoon’s skull was broke, brain matter and blood spewing out of its ears and mouth, and then my dog bit down again, so hard that one of the raccoon’s eyes popped out.It was fucking disgusting, then my dog just drops the bloody mangled mess of a raccoon corpse down onto the ground.It was still, like, 6 so I had time to bring him to a nearby vet to check for rabies.  Luckily, he didn’t have me, and the vet even cleaned him up for me and brushed his teeth.We haven’t seen a single raccoon in the backyard in months. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

We have exterminators now who help with the pest problem, we don't NEED them killing shit anymore.  Dogs, however, still help.

├───── >I want a source that explains, with backed numbers and good argumentation, that says how dogs are better than cats.You don't even gotta read all of mine, read like one or two.  They all prove dogs are better than cats.I can give a few of my own reasons:1. They're smarter2. They take commands3. They're easier to train>as i personally would think just because of the pest control, cats are more important on a basic level, whereas dogs help on more complex things like the drug sniffing.Dogs are better on a basic level, too.  They can do the advanced shit like drug sniffing and chasing down criminals, but they also do basic stuff like pest control better.While cats are slightly better at killing bugs and mice, dogs can still kill both of those things relatively easily.They keep the smaller pests like mice and chipmunks out of your yard, and they can keep the larger pests like raccoons, gophers, rabbits, large rats, snakes, hawks, deer, and possums out of the yard, whereas a cat can't keep most of them out.A dog can scare off an entire group of raccoons whereas a cat has trouble with one. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├────── But they dont kill the pests, oh and by the way, deer, snakes and most of the other animals you mentioned are not pests, but i understand you want them out of your yard.And cats are not slightly better at killing rodents, they are exeptionally better at killing them, mostly because they hunt for sport, not food, so they can kill more than they can eat in a day. Whereas dogs dont kill rodendts, pretty much at all, unless trained for that spesific reason, and that could be hard because the dogs are bulky and slower than cats.  ⏤ by *OdinusLupinus* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)
├─────── >And cats are not slightly better at killing rodents, they are exeptionally better at killing themIdk about all that.  Dogs are really good, maybe even better than cats, at killing every kind of rodent except for mice.  Dogs can kill mice fairly easily, too.Dogs are very fast, though they have slower reflexes than cats, they are still capable of catching and killing mice and other small rodents.If you've ever seen a dog chasing chipmunks around a backyard you'll know what I'm talking about.Furthermore, their superior sense of smell, hearing, intelligence, and strength allows them to track and hunt stuff better than cats.  Tracking and hunting are the reasons the Neanderthals bred them in the first place.>dogs are bulky and slower than cats.They have slower *reflexes* but they run faster than cats, which allows them to catch smaller, faster rodents.Cats have the sharper claws, but dogs have a stronger bite and larger, sharper teeth, and stronger legs for running and pinning stuff down. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├──────── More often than not, rodents live in tight, small and overall tiny spaces where few dogs would fit, and that really just stops their fast speed because there would be nowhere to run, therefore making the reflexes superior, by a longshot.  ⏤ by *OdinusLupinus* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)
├───────── Ok, that's true, I'll give you that, but smaller breeds of dog can get into those spaces and kill the mice anyways, although cats have the advantage of having faster reflexes. But that's only one kind of pest.  A cat can barely take care of anything larger than a mouse, whereas a dog will be able to keep all those other pests off your property, and they are superior to cats when it comes to hunting outside in the yard. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├────────── deleted 
├─────── >But they dont kill the pestsIf they catch whatever their chasing after and it's either smaller or of similar size, they kill it.Usually all it takes is one bite, and if it doesn't then they get bit a second time. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### Dogs are more responsibility as well that is why some people tend to opt for cats. Dogs will give you affection on both your and their terms but cats really only want affection on their terms.

├───── >I grew up with Siberian huskies. They constantly fought, had serious hip issues, CONSTANTLY had to be walked and they would pull like the dickens.The pulling and constant walking just has to do with the fact that they're large dogs and require lots of space and exercise.The fighting is probably due to the fact that they're both large dogs and both of them are fighting for "seniority" or whatever, they're trying to establish dominance over one another.>I graduated and adopted two cats.

├──────── Sorry, I guess cats just don’t like you or something. Shame, because they genuinely make for great pets, they’re just different to dogs.It’s nto like I think cats are better than dogs or anything btw.

├───────── Dogs are scientifically proven to be better than cats, so everything after that’s pretty opinionated.  I own a dog so I’m guessing the scent of the dog on me sets them off or something.I’ve met nice cats that let me pet them, and I’ve met asshole cats that hiss and scratch.  I’ve yet to meet an asshole dog tho.And plus the thing I like about dogs over cats is the ability to take commands.Dogs can learn lots of different commands and memorize them.

├──── “Most aren’t” is your perception, probably because you think they’re going to be like dogs. cats don’t bond to people as easily as dogs, they don’t like when you play with them or approach them like you do dogs. Personally, I’ve seen more dogs who are problem animals (fighting, tearing stuff up, pissing on the carpet making a mess, biting, etc) much more than I’ve seen cats. I have never had a cat react to me the way you describe them too, hissing and hiding like that. And even if they did, I’d rather deal with hissing and hiding until they like me instead of the above problems listed for dogs. Like I said, there’s no better or worse, it’s just based on preference.  ⏤ by *AwesomeAni* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)

##### I don’t want my pet to fucking follow me around all day. I’m perfectly happy for them to go off and do their own thing while I do mine.Incidentally, plenty of cats clearly care about their owners. They just express it in a different way to dogs.The only times I’ve been hurt by my cats were my fault. One time, I tried to pick her up to eat her away from a dog that would fucking kill her if he caught her, and she scratched me in her hurry to get away.I don’t judge a pet by their usefulness. Incidentally, cats absolutely can spend a lot of time outside (it depends on the cat, 2 of mine spent a lot of time outside, the third will onto go out if someone goes out with her), and some cats will take on animals larger than them. Again, no every cat is the same. Some are stupid.Ok, in fairness I don’t have to deal with raccoons because there aren’t any in my country. But at he same time, I’ve definitely seen a video of a cat standing up to a raccoon and getting it to back off.Cats absolutely do jump up to get attention. One of my cats loves to lie on my torso when I’m on my bed.You have very little experience with cats, I can tell, and have decided you know what every cat is like off a tiny sample size. You’ve also apparently decided there’s a way to subjectively rate how good a pet different animals are, which misses the rather glaring problem that different people have different metrics and ways to judge how good a pet is.

They were bred by the Neanderthals to help do work on farms, to hunt and track, and to protect the villages they lived in against intruders and predators.  Cats were bred to keep mice and other small pests out of factories and cities and stuff.That's why dogs follow you around all the time, and that's why cats do their own thing.And dogs following you around all the time isn't true, dogs have better things to do than constantly follow around their owners.Dogs will follow their owners around occasionally, but if there's a squirrel outside or if they're tired or just wanna lay down on the rug and chew on a bone they won't be following you around. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ -1/ ↓ 0)

├─── >Dogs are needy, cats are independentWhile this is sort of true, dogs aren't all that needy.  A dog is just as capable, maybe even more capable, than a cat at taking care of itself, it's just that dogs are loyal to their owners and wait for them to do everything.  A dog would be more than capable to hunt and kill its own food cuz that's what they were bred to do, just like how cats sometimes kill and eat mice and shit.Dogs are just loyal to their owners, and won't do most things unless you tell them to.You can't really blame them for being the way they are, cuz that's why they were bred in the first place.They were bred by the early humans to take commands and hunt.

Like everything you said about dogs is also true about cats. I don't get why cats need to follow a stereotype but dogs are so complex and shit.  ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 8/ ↓ 0)
├───── >But they are actually way more needy than cats, and cats are loyal too?Well yeah, because dogs were bred to take commands, cats weren't.  That's why they're needy.>Like everything you said about dogs is also true about cats.Not necessarily.  A cat won't alert you if there's someone breaking into your house.  A cat also won't attack an intruder or take commands. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├────── Yeah they will. Dude, just look it up. I've seen cats who alerted their owners about potential fire and robbers. It's also completely normal to train cats.  ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
├─────── Cats alert their owners of fires and robbers, but so do dogs, and against a robber, a dog will attack them, a cat will not. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├──────── You don't know that. Some dogs are so friendly or small they're not capable of attacking robbers, the same way some cats actually are. There are many different breeds of cats and dogs and their personalities and physical are not the same, you can't generalize them.  ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)
├───────── > Some dogs are so friendly or small they're not capable of attacking robbersEven a small dog will attack a robber.  It won't do anything, but they'll  still attack them.Smaller dogs are usually the more aggressive ones. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

├──── Or you’re just making an outrageous claim and people are calling you on it. Most of these responses aren’t people necessarily saying cats are better, just that your claim of “it’s scientifically proven that dogs are better” is total BS  ⏤ by *AwesomeAni* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├───── It is scientifically proven. Dogs are better than cats almost 100% of the time.They're smarter, faster, stronger, loyal to their owners, protective of their homes and families, and are friendlier and better with kids. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
├────── They’re smarter, but that only makes them more useful. I don’t need an animal that brings me my shoes if it means I have to deal with it tearing stuff up, training, more responsibility, and drool. Only certain dogs are faster than cats. Cheetah’s are cats, remember. Cats are fast. Yeah, stronger. Stronger jaws, stronger bites, sounds fun. I don’t want a strong animal. You say loyal, I say subservient. I want a creature that’s independent a lot of the time. If someone is hostile to a cat, they leave. If someone is hostile to a dog, he’ll come back for more. [and that’s been proven. ](http://messybeast.com/cat-dog.htm) Protective can mean innocent people get hurt. I don’t want an animal that’s aggressive for ANY reason. Dogs HAVE to be friendlier: they depend on humans. [also proven ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.mic.com/articles/amp/104474/brain-scans-reveal-what-dogs-really-think-of-us) Dogs are more likely to accidentally hurt babies, and bites are much more serious than scratches. Once again: what YOU PERCEIVE as being “the best” traits aren’t necessarily the traits I want in an animal. [here’s a related article. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201002/personality-differences-between-dog-and-cat-owners%3famp) It discusses the personality differences between cat people and dog people. It’s showing how your preference between the two is based sort of around your personality and wanting an animal that reflects that personality. It might show you a little bit more about why someone might not want a dog, because you somehow don’t understand that people are different.  ⏤ by *AwesomeAni* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

├─── >my personal experience has been more positive with cats (my dogbite scars affirm this)Ah.  I had a similar experience with my dog.  I had just gotten out of the shower and went upstairs to get dressed.  I walked up and my dog was in there.  He got excited and jumped on me, and because I had just come out of the shower, I didn't have any clothes on, so one of his nails cut into my leg, and as he was jumping down, the nail cut down deeper into my leg and left this long, nasty cut.  It happened 3 years ago, and I still have the mark.Play-biting is often annoying, my dog was play fighting with my dad and he bit a little too hard on my dad's hand(he was still young, only 4 months old, it was an accident) and he put holes in my dad's hand with his canine teeth.Dogs can do more damage than cats, but dogs are also less likely to attack their owners or other pets than cats.>sorry if i came across as demeaning or rude.Nah it's fine ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
